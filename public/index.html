              1 ~ SPÅRAKOFF One of the best ways to experience the sights of
              Helsinki is to jump on the famous old red pub tram which rides
              through the city centre from mid-May to the end of August. The
              classic 30 seat pub car dates back to 1959 and is furnished with
              mahogany, brass and velvet. The city tour begins at the Mikonkatu
              tram stop near the Central Railway Station and departs every hour
              from 14:00 to 20:00, Tuesday to Saturday. Providing a fantastic
              alternative to pub crawling, the bar on board offers Finnish beers
              from the Koff brewery, ciders and soft drinks, alongside shots of
              Salmiakki, Jalovina and the 250 times distilled Koskenkorva vodka.
              There's no need to pre-book (it costs around €9) and you can stay
              on for the entire hour long ride or jump on and off at Linnanmäki,
              Opera House, Old Student House at Aleksanterinkatu and Market
              Square tram stops. Stand at the back of the tram, or sit on the
              left, for the best views. Beer (0.5l) €9+ Wine €7+
