                        One of the best ways to experience the sights of Helsinki is to jump on the famous old red pub
                        tram which rides through the city centre from mid-May to the end of August. The classic 30 seat
                        pub car dates back to 1959 and is furnished with mahogany, brass and velvet. The city tour
                        begins at the Mikonkatu tram stop near the Central Railway Station and departs every hour from
                        14:00 to 20:00, Tuesday to Saturday. Providing a fantastic alternative to pub crawling, the bar
                        on board offers Finnish beers from the Koff brewery, ciders and soft drinks, alongside shots of
                        Salmiakki, Jalovina and the 250 times distilled Koskenkorva vodka. There's no need to pre-book
                        (it costs around €9) and you can stay on for the entire hour long ride or jump on and off at
                        Linnanmäki, Opera House, Old Student House at Aleksanterinkatu and Market Square tram stops.
                        Stand at the back of the tram, or sit on the left, for the best views.
